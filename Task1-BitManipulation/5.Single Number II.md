# Approach:
To solve the problem of finding the single element that appears exactly once in an array where all other elements appear three times.

- For each bit position (from 0 to 31 for a 32-bit integer), count how many numbers in the array have that specific bit set to 1.
- If a bit is set in a number, increment the count for that bit position.
- Since every number except one appears three times, we use the modulo operation (% 3) to filter out those bits that appear in multiples of 3.
- If the count of a bit is not divisible by 3, it means that bit belongs to the unique number.
- Now we will modify the result using bitwise **OR |**.

# Documentation
=> The above code Finds the single element that appears exactly once in an array where every other element appears three times.
### Parameters:
nums (List[int]): A list of integers where every element appears three times except for one.
### Process:
- Initialize **result** to 0, which will store the unique number.
- For each bit position from 0 to 31:
  - Count how many numbers have that bit set to 1.
  - If the count of a bit modulo 3 is 1, it means that bit belongs to the unique number.
  - Use bitwise OR to set that bit in **result**.
- Handle negative numbers:
  - If the 31st bit (sign bit for a 32-bit integer) is set to **1**, convert **result** to a negative number by subtracting 2^32.
- Return the **result**.
