# Approach:
- The result of the AND operation can be determined by finding the common prefix of the binary representations of left and right.
- As long as left and right are different, there will be bits in their binary representations that differ, which will cause the AND to become 0 in those positions.
- We can continuously shift both left and right to the right until they become equal. Each shift effectively removes the least significant bit.
- Count how many shifts we perform, as this indicates how many positions we need to shift back to get the final result.
- Once left equals right, the remaining value represents the common prefix. We need to shift this value back to the left by the number of shifts we counted to get the final AND result.

# Documentation:
The above code computes the bitwise AND of all numbers in the inclusive range [left, right].

### Parameters:
left (int): The starting integer of the range.
right (int): The ending integer of the range.

### Process:
- Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of right shifts performed.
- While **left** is not equal to **right**:
  - Right shift both **left** and **right** to remove the least significant bit.
  - Increment the counter for each shift.
- Once **left** equals **right**, left shift **left** back by the count of shifts.
- Return the final result.
