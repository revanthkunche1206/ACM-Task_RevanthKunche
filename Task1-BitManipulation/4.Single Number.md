# Approach:
To solve this problem  we can utilize the properties of the XOR (^) bitwise operator. Here's how XOR helps in finding the unique element in an array where every other element appears exactly twice:

#### Properties of XOR:
- a ^ a = 0: When a number is XORed with itself, the result is 0.
- a ^ 0 = a: XORing a number with 0 gives the number itself.
- XOR is commutative and associative, meaning the order of operations doesn't matter (a ^ b ^ a = a ^ a ^ b = 0 ^ b = b).
### Using XOR to Find the Unique Element:
When you XOR all the elements of the array, the pairs of elements that are the same will cancel each other out, leaving the unique number.
- For example, for the array [4,1,2,1,2], the XOR process looks like this:
  - 4 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 1 ^ 2 = (4 ^ (1 ^ 1) ^ (2 ^ 2)) = 4 ^ 0 ^ 0 = 4.

# Documatation:
=>The above code will find the single element that appears only once in an array where every other element appears twice.
### Parameters:
nums (List[int]): A non-empty list of integers where all elements appear twice except for one.

### Process:
- Initialize **result** to 0, which will store the XOR result of all the elements in the array.
- Iterate through the array **nums**:
  - XOR each element with **result**.
  - This ensures that all pairs of numbers that appear twice will cancel out to 0.
  - The only remaining value in **result** after the loop will be the unique number.
- Return the **result**.
