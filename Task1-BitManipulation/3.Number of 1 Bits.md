# Approach:
We want to count how many of the binary digits are 1 in the number given.We can check the last bit of the number in each iteration to check if it is 1 using the bitwise AND operation (n & 1).
if  it is **1** we will increase the count of the result by 1.Now we right shift the number (n >>= 1), which moves all bits one position to the right, effectively removing the bit we just checked.

# Documentation:
=> The above code will count number of 1's in the binary representation of the given number and returns the count.
#### Parameters:
n (int): A positive integer whose binary representation we want to analyze.

### Process:
- Initialize **result** to 0, which will store the count of set bits (1s).
- While **n** is not 0:
  - Check if the last bit is 1 using **n & 1**.
  - If it is 1, increment **result** by 1.
  - Shift **n** one position to the right **(n >>= 1)**, which removes the last bit.
- Once the loop ends (when **n** becomes 0), return the **result**.
