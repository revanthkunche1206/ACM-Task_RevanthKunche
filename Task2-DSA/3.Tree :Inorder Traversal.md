# Approach:
- For Inorder tarversal,First we should print left node ,then root and then right node.
- So first print left node ,then root,and then right node.
- Then the root node is changed the left node and the process will continue.
- This will be done by using recursion.

# Documentation:

- First when the funtion is called it will initialise the recursion function.
- Now in that if the root is none it will print **Tree is empty**.
- Else the recursive funtion is called with left node as a parameter and printed.
- After that it will print root node.
- Then the recursive funtion is called with right node as a parameter and printed.
- This process continues till all the nodes are printed.
