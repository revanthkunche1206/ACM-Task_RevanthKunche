# Approach:
- For Inorder tarversal,First we should print left node ,then root and then right node.
- So first we will be keep on changing our root node to the left node until there no other left node.
- After that it will first print left node ,then root,and then right node.
- This will be done by using recursion.

# Documentation:

- First when the funtion is called it will initialise the recursion function.
- Now in that if the root is none it will print **Tree is empty**.
- Else the recursion is called with left node as a parameter.
- if there is no left node it will print that node and the root node and agian the fuction is called with right node as a parameter.
- This process continues till all the nodes are printed.
