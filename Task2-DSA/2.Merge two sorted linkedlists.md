# Approach:
- To merge two singly linkedlists.
- First I have linked the tail of one linked list to the head of the another linked list.
- And then I have sorted the linked list.
- And finally returned the output

# Documentation:
- First this function will check if the head1 and head2 empty or not.
- if head1 is empty it will return another linkedlist.
- if head2 is empty it will return first linkedlist.
- if both are None it will return none.
- Else the tail if the first linked list will be connected to the head of the second linked list.
- Now while loop is initailised for sorting it will check if the data of current node is greater than that of next node.
- if it is greater it swap the values of the corresponding nodes.
- And finally it will return the output.
