# Approach:
- To remove the duplicates in a singlylinked list.First I have initiated a while loop.
- In each iteration it will check if the data of current node and next is equal or not.
- if they are equal then that node will be skipped and the link between them will be disconnected.
- Else it will move the next nodes.
- And finnaly return the output linkedlist which dosn't have duplicates.

# Documentation:
- Fist the code will check if the linkedlist is empty or not. If it is empty it will None.
- Else the variable current will be assigned to head of the linkedlist.
- Then the loop will started and it will check if the current node and next node have the same data or not.
- if they are equal the link between them will disconnected.
- Else it will move to the next nodes.
- And the output linkedlist will be returned.
