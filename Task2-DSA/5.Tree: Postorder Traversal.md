# Approach:
- For Postorder tarversal,First we should print left node ,then right and then root node.
- So first the recursive function is called and the left node is printed.
- Then the recursive function is called and the right node is printed.
- Then the root node is printed.
- This will be done by using recursion.
# Documentation:
- First when the funtion is called it will initialise the recursion function.
- Now in that if the root is none it will print Tree is empty.
- Else the recursive function is called with left node as a parameter and printed.
- After that recursive function is called with right node as a parameter and printed.
- Then the root node is printed.
- This process continues till all the nodes are printed.
